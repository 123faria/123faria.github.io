<ul><li>HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
   CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements.
   Before taking PROG 109 class I didn't have any knowledge about HTML, CSS, OR JavaScript.</li>
   <li> I used a template for building my portfolio</li>
   <li>The most challenging part for me was the validate form.</li>
