        <h1>All About Me!</h1>
    <p>My name is Faria Kazimi. I was born and grew up in “Kabul” the capital of Afghanistan.
    Afghanistan is a landlocked country located within South Central Asia. Kabul is the capital and largest city of Afghanistan.

    I moved to the United States in August 2015 with my family. We moved to three different states since we have moved.
    First, we were in California for a while and then we moved to Oregon and now we are in Washington State.
    Among all states I really like and enjoy living in Washington because the weather and nature is beautiful.
    In my life there is so many important people, but few are so important without whom a single day is very difficult for me.
    Such persons in my life are my mom, dad and my brothers.
    I am very attached to my mom, she is not just my mom she is my best friend who motivates and encourage me each and every step in my life.
    She believes in me more than myself.  My dad who always supports me and make sure that we have everything that we need in our life.
    My brothers who are so supportive and caring. They are so loving. I am very fortunate to have them as my family.
    I like to learn new things, and in my free times I like to explore new places, and do photography.
    I also want to motivate people and like to get inspirations from great people.
