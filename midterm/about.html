<h1>All About me!</h1>

  <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/afghanistan/afghanistan.html">https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/afghanistan/afghanistan.html</a></P>
<p>I moved to the United States in August 2015 with my family. We moved to three different states since we have moved.</p>
<p>First, we were in California for a while and then we moved to Oregon and now we are in Washington State.</p>
<p>Among all states I really like and enjoy living in Washington because the weather and nature is beautiful.</P>
<P>In my life there is so many important people, but few are so important without whom a single day is very difficult for me.</P>
<p>Such persons in my life are my mom, dad and my brothers.
I am very attached to my mom, she is not just my mom she is my best friend who motivates and encourage me each and every step in my life.</P>
<p>She believes in me more than myself.<p>My dad who always supports me and make sure that we have everything that we need in our life.</P>
<p>My brothers who are so supportive and caring.They are so loving.I am very fortunate to have them as my family.</P>
<p>I like to learn new things, and in my free times I like to explore new places, and do photography.</p>
<p>I also want to motivate people and like to get inspirations from great people.</p>
<p>Currently I am a student at Bellevue college in DBA(Database Analyst) track.
One of my short term goal is to learn new skills and succssfuly graduate from year up porgrm and geting a job.</p>
